I put together a quick project involving an indivuidually adressable LED strip and a bluetooth enabled controller.  This was inspired by the Stranger Things show, in which a string of chirstmas lights on a wall with letters painted beneath them was used to comunicate via blinking out messages.  The software ecosystem surrounding this was super easy and well maintained and everything was up and running within an hour.

The board used was the "Adafruit Feather M0 Bluefruit LE" for which board suppourt is avaliable in the arduino package.  The board features a small arm core and a BTLE module which speaks AT commands and is connected via a hardware SPI.  A NeoPixel LED strip was used, for which libraries and sample code are readily avaliable.  Hardware assembly consisted of soldering 3 pin JST connectors to the LED strip and the board (vbat,gnd,data).  

LED power consumption is about 60 mA per LED on maximum brightness.  I didn't do any percise measuerments but got 4 to 6 hours life out of a 600mAh battery, with one LED on at a time.
